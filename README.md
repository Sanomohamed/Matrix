## Overview

The Kilometer to Mile Converter is a simple Java application designed to convert distances from kilometers to miles. This tool demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts and unit conversion.

## Features
- Converts a distance given in kilometers to miles.
- Displays the result in a user-friendly format.

- ## How It Works

1. The `kilotomile` class contains methods to set a distance in kilometers and convert it to miles.
2. The `Matrix` class creates an instance of `kilotomile`, sets a distance in kilometers, and prints the converted distance in miles.

   kilotomile Class:

setKilometer(double kilometer): Sets the distance in kilometers.
getKilometer(): Returns the distance in kilometers.
getMile(): Converts the distance from kilometers to miles using the conversion factor 1 kilometer â‰ˆ 0.62 miles.
toString(): Returns a string representation of the kilotomile object.
Matrix Class:

Creates an instance of kilotomile.
Sets a distance of 20.0 kilometers.
Prints the distance in kilometers and its equivalent in miles.
